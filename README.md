# Advanced_Algorithm-project_2

# Usage
1. Ensure Python3 is installed on your machine.
- https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/msi/
  
2.  Open in editor of your choice, we used VScode open the folder you downloaded from GitHub

3. Download the python files `algorithm_1.py` and `algorithm_2.py`

4. Save the Python file with an appropriate name, such as `algorithm_1.py` and `algorithm_2.py`.
   
5. You can replace the Example Input values with your own data.

6. Run the Python script using your preferred Python interpreter or command prompt.
7. 
8. To Run the program using the command on terminal: 
- python algorithm1.py
- python algorithm2.py

if this didnt work use 
- python3 algorithm1.py
- python3 algorithm2.py

# Algorithm 1: Optimizing Production Lines

## Description
The algorithm reduces assembly line delays by efficiently assigning steps to multiple stations. It aims to minimize the slowest station's time by allowing a single station to handle consecutive steps. The output is the longest duration among the stations after this optimization.

## Example Input
```python
Durations = [15, 15, 30, 30, 45]
Stations = [3]
```

# Algorithm 2: Unique Starting City

## Description
The goal is to find the longest string chain from a list of strings. A string chain is formed when you can remove one character from a string to get another string, and so on, with each new string being present in the original list. The algorithm returns the longest chain in descending order (from the longest string to the shortest one).

## Example Input
```python
Strings = ["abde", "abc", "abd", "abcde", "ade", "ae", "1abde", "abcdef"]
```
